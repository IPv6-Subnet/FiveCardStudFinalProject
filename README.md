# FiveCardStudFinalProject
This is a final project I created for a Java college class I took during the summer. It involves creating a 5-card-stud poker game, where a player can interact with a GUI and play
against a dealer. I am still getting used to Git, so if something looks funny let me know and I will try my best to get it figured out. I hope you enjoy the project, as it took
many hours, a ton of trial/error, and help from others to get it set up. Enjoy the game and may the odds be ever in your favor!
